aumentar disminuir riesgo tener una enfermedad trastorno las investigaciones estn avanzando nuestro entendimiento del papel gentica salud mental aunque hay variantes genticas comunes asociadas trastornos raros como sndrome del cromosoma frgil sndrome rett ninguna variante gentica puede predecir certeza alguien llegue tener trastorno mental mayora casos incluso variante gentica mayor cantidad investigaciones apoyo aumenta riesgo llegar tener una enfermedad por apenas porcentaje muy pequeo conocer su historia familiar importante para ayudarle comprender su riesgo tener una enfermedad mental saber tiene una estas variantes genticas respuesta directa esta pregunta todava algn posible investigacin gentica pueda posibilitar diagnstico determinado trastorno mental ofrecer

componentes genticos comunes autismo trastorno dficit atencin hiperactividad enfermedad bipolar esquizofrenia depresin mayor estudios tambin han encontrado hay variantes genticas especficas estn asociadas mayor riesgo ciertos trastornos como trastorno del espectro autista esquizofrenia algunos estudios recientes han comenzado identificar marcadores genticos asociados ciertos trastornos

ocultndose sistema inmunitario tanto tiempo como sea posible esconden colocando molculas su pared celular ven casi idnticas la molculas encuentran corazn la articulaciones piel tejidos cerebrales del nio esto llama mimetismo molecular permite bacteria estreptoccica evadir ser detectada por mucho tiempo eventualmente sistema inmunitario del nio reconoce la molculas la bacteria estreptoccicas como extraas cuerpo reacciona ante ellas mediante produccin anticuerpos sin embargo debido mimetismo molecular la bacteria sistema inmunitario slo reacciona la molculas estreptococos sino tambin la molculas del husped humano fueron imitadas decir sistema ataca la molculas la bacteria imitaron pero pertenece propios tejidos del nio hay estudios realizados otros lugares han demostrado algunos anticuerpos anti cerebro presentan reaccin cruzada atacan cerebro causando trastorno obsesivo compulsivo tic otros sntomas neuropsiquitricos pandas pandas consideran trastornos peditricos tpicamente aparecen primero niez partir tres aos edad hasta pubertad las reacciones la infecciones por estreptococos son muy poco frecuentes despus aos pero investigadores reconocen pandas podran ocurrir aunque rara vez adolescencia poco probable alguien tenga sntomas neuropsiquitricos despus una infeccin por estreptococos por primera vez como adulto pero esto ha estudiado profundidad posible adolescentes
